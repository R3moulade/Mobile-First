                    <p class="artic">Heidi Bielfeldt and Dorte Rydahl have joined forces to open GenBRUN. The store opened June 4th. Before that, Heidi<br>
                        managed the recycling shop Heidi's Mixbix in Mejlgade, while Dorte has had a larger warehouse as a flea market in<br>
                        Hinnerup, from where she has been selling on Instagram under the name "Skrappedulledorte's loppebiks (flea market)".<br>
                       Heidi has had Heidi's Mixbix in Mejlgade for 13 years, and didn’t really think she would ever leave. But now that <br>
                       the lease for the shop became vacant, it was the right time. We saw the room for the first time on May 28th, then <br>
                       we got the keys and a week later, and on Friday, June 4th, we opened. We know each other from what was called <br>
                       RetroGuld years ago; a recurring recycling market on Godsbanen.<br>

                    <p class="artic">For both Heidi Bielfeldt and Dorte Rydahl, their interest in recycling has been aroused for years. Heidi has an art<br>
                        degree, and she has used the basement shop in Mejlgade as a combined workshop and second-hand shop. The things she<br>
                        does, she does because she wants to and cannot help. Of course, she wants her work to have a serious expression, <br>
                        but it’s not pieces that need a great, in-depth analysis. They are what they are. Besides, Heidi loves to collect<br>
                        and has probably always done so ... the more, the better. She loves to go hunting and find something new for the<br>
                        collection. She collects dolls, doll- and clown-heads, old chandeliers and other gadgets and plastic napkins.<br>
                        She likes to take things apart and put them in a different context so they get a new function.<br>

                    so her fascination with old, used things has started early. Things that others think are ugly, she loves them.<br>
                    <br>
                    We love brown! Brown is many things. For us, brown is the new variety.
                    Dorte has been saying that for many years.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is very much a feeling when we go out and find new things. There are things you cannot keep your fingers off of,<br>
                    but just have to take them with you home. She has been to so many markets and to so many recycling stores over the<br>
                    years that she instinctively knows when she finds something quite special.<br>
